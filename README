Usage:
./configure VARNISHSRC=DIR

VARNISHSRC is the directory of the Varnish source tree for which to
compile your vmod. Both the VARNISHSRC and VARNISHSRC/include
will be added to the include search paths for your module.

Make targets:
make - builds the vmod
make install - installs your vmod in VMODDIR
make check - runs the unit tests in src/tests/*.vtc

In your VCL you could then use this vmod like the following. This
sets the request header X-GeoIP to the requestor's geo (or Unknown).

import geoip;

sub vcl_recv {
        set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
	set req.http.X-GeoIP = geoip.country(req.http.X-Forwarded-For)
}
